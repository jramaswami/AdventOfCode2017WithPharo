# Day 1 :: Inverse Captcha

## Solution to Part 1

To solve this problem, I took the input (captcha) and concatenated it to
itself.  For example, given the captcha '1122', I transform that into
'11221122'.  I then step through the string from the middle, i.e. from `index
:= captcha size + 1`.  On each step I test whether the current digit equals the
previous digit.  If so, the digit's integer value is added to the result.

```smalltalk
Day1Solver >> solveA: captcha
	| kaptcha index result |
	result := 0.
	kaptcha := captcha , captcha.
	index := captcha size + 1.
	index to: kaptcha size do: [ :i | 
		| s t |
		s := kaptcha copyFrom: i - 1 to: i - 1.
		t := kaptcha copyFrom: i to: i.
		s = t
			ifTrue: [ result := result + t asInteger ] ].
	^ result
```

## Solution to Part 2

The solution to Part 2 uses the same trick of concatenated captcha.  However,
instead of an offset of -1, the offset is `captcha size // 2`.

```smalltalk
Day1Solver >> solveB: captcha
	| kaptcha offset result |
	result := 0.
	kaptcha := captcha , captcha.
	offset := captcha size // 2.
	1 to: captcha size do: [ :i | 
		| j |
		j := i + offset.
		(kaptcha copyFrom: i to: i) = (kaptcha copyFrom: j to: j)
			ifTrue: [ result := result + (kaptcha copyFrom: i to: i) asInteger ] ].
	^ result
```
