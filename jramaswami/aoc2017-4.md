# Day 4: High-Entropy Passphrases

This was a pretty straight forward puzzle.  Solutions to both parts make use
of the following method to test if a collection has no duplicates in it:

```smalltalk
Day4Solver >> containsNoDuplicates: aCollection
	^ ((aCollection size) = ((aCollection asSet) size))
```

## Solution to Part 1

To solve part 1, I have a method to validate passphrases.  This method breaks
the passphrase into tokens and makes sure there are no duplicate tokens using
the method described above.

```smalltalk
Day4Solver >> isValidPassphraseA: aPassphrase
	^ (self containsNoDuplicates: (aPassphrase findTokens: ' ')) 
```

Then it is a matter of breaking the input into individual passpharases and
counting the number of valid passphrases.

```smalltalk
Day4Solver >> solveA: input
	^ ((input findTokens: String cr)
		collect: [ :passphrase | 
			(self isValidPassphraseA: passphrase)
				ifTrue: [ 1 ]
				ifFalse: [ 0 ] ]) sum
```

## Solution to Part 2

The only difference between part 1 and part 2 is that before checking for
duplicate tokens in the passphrase, each token is sorted.

```smalltalk
Day4Solver >> isValidPassphraseB: aPassphrase
	^ self containsNoDuplicates: ((aPassphrase findTokens: ' ') collect: [ :p | p sort ])
```

```smalltalk
Day4Solver >> solveB: input
	^ ((input findTokens: String cr)
		collect: [ :passphrase | 
			(self isValidPassphraseB: passphrase)
				ifTrue: [ 1 ]
				ifFalse: [ 0 ] ]) sum
```
