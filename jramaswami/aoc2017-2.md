# Day 2: Corruption Checksum

## Solution to Part 1

When I solved this with Python I was able to do it with a one-liner:

```python
sum((max(row) - min(row) for row in spreadsheet))
```

I was not able to be quite so succint in Pharo, although that is down my lack
of Smalltalk fluency.  (See juliendelplanque's solution for a good one-liner in
Pharo.) My Pharo solution was along the same lines as my Python solution
though.

```smalltalk
Day2Solver >> solveA: aSpreadsheet

	| minimums maximums |
	minimums := aSpreadsheet collect: [ :row | row min ].
	maximums := aSpreadsheet collect: [ :row | row max ].
	^ (minimums with: maximums collect: [ :m :n | n - m ]) sum
```

## Solution to Part 2

Part two was also solvable with one line in Python:

```python
sum((sum((a//b for a,b in product(sn, sn) if a != b and a % b == 0)) for sn in spreadsheet))
```

I struggled to find a solution in Pharo.  Again my lack of fluency.  I found
the `SequencableCollections >> combinations: atATimeDo:` method most helpful.
Something like `SequencableCollections >> combinations: atATimeCollect:` would
have allowed a more succint solution but I could not find anything along that
line.

I split the solution of Part 2 into two functions:

```smalltalk
Day2Solver >> rowChecksumB: aSpreasheetRow
	| s |
	s := 0.
	aSpreasheetRow 
		combinations: 2
		atATimeDo: [ :pr | 
			| a b |
			a := pr min.
			b := pr max.
			(b rem: a) = 0
				ifTrue: [ s := s + (b / a) ] ].
	^ s
```

and 

```smalltalk
Day2Solver >> solveB: aSpreadsheet
	^ (aSpreadsheet collect: [ :row | self rowChecksumB: row ]) sum.
```

Again, juliendelplanque has a one-liner for Part 2 as well.
