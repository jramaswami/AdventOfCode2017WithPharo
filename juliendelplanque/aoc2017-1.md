## Solution of puzzle 1
In the first problem, a list of integers is provided and one has to compute the sum of the integers in this list for which the integer following it is the same.
Note: The list has to be considered has circular. It means that if the last integer of the list is the same as the first, it has to be added to the sum.

To solve this problem, I create a `AOCSolver1` object. Which will provide a `#solve` method to solve the problem according to the integer list in `#data` instance variable.
I also create a `#puzzleData` methods which hold my raw puzzle input. If the `#data` instance variable is not initialized, the integers list extracted from `#puzzleData` is returned.

```

```
AOCSolver1>>#data
	^ data ifNil: [ self puzzleData collect: #digitValue as: Array ]
```

```
data: anArrayOfIntegers
	data := anArrayOfIntegers
```

Some example of input/output are provided with this puzzle. Let's create unit tests for them in `AOCSolver1Test` class:
```
AOCSolver1Test>>#setUp
	solver := AOCSolver1 new
```

```
AOCSolver1Test>>#testSolve1
	solver
		data: #(1 1 2 2).

	self assert: solver solve equals: 3
```

```
AOCSolver1Test>>#testSolve2
	solver
		data: #(1 1 1 1).

	self assert: solver solve equals: 4
```

```
AOCSolver1Test>>#testSolve3
	solver
		data: #(1 2 3 4).

	self assert: solver solve equals: 0
```

```
AOCSolver1Test>>#testSolve4
	solver
		data: #(9 1 2 1 2 1 2 9).

	self assert: solver solve equals: 9
```

Now we have our unit tests, we can implement the `#solve` method of `AOCSolver1`.
My implementation is the following:
```
AOCSolver1>>#solve
	| list matchingSum |
	list := self data.
	matchingSum := (list overlappingPairsCollect: [ :a :b |
							a = b
								ifTrue: [ a ]
								ifFalse: [ 0 ] ]) sum.
	"Do not forget last and first items. :-)"
	list last = list first
		ifTrue: [ matchingSum := matchingSum + list last ].
	^ matchingSum
```

Which makes all my unit tests green and, with my puzzle input, returns the number `1047`.

## Solution of puzzle 2
The second problem is similar to the first but instead of considering the equality of an item with the following, one need to consider the equality of an item and the item at the position `current + (list size / 2)` (again we work on a circular list).

Again, some examples of input/output are provided. Before implementing the `#solveBis` method of `AOCSolver1`, let's write some
unit tests from these examples:
```
AOCSolver1Test>>#testSolveBis1
	solver
		data: #(1 2 1 2).

	self assert: solver solveBis equals: 6
```

```
AOCSolver1Test>>#testSolveBis2
	solver
		data: #(1 2 2 1).

	self assert: solver solveBis equals: 0
```

```
AOCSolver1Test>>#testSolveBis3
	solver
		data: #(1 2 3 4 2 5).

	self assert: solver solveBis equals: 4
```

```
AOCSolver1Test>>#testSolveBis4
	solver
		data: #(1 2 3 1 2 3).

	self assert: solver solveBis equals: 12
```

```
AOCSolver1Test>>#testSolveBis5
	solver
		data: #(1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5).

	self assert: solver solveBis equals: 4
```

Now we have our unit tests, we can implement the `#solveBis` method of `AOCSolver1`.
My implementation is the following:

```
AOCSolver1>>#solveBis
	| list sum |
	list := self data.

	sum := (list collectWithIndex: [ :item :index |
				"In Pharo, indices are starting at 1. :-)"
				item = (list at: ((index - 1 + (list size // 2)) % list size) + 1)
					ifTrue: [ item ]
					ifFalse: [ 0 ] ]) sum.
	^ sum
```

A word about this implementation. In Pharo, indices are starting at `1` which is
not the case in every language. To be able to use the modulo operator `%` correctly
to compute the item half-the-list away of the current, we need to do the little trick
which consists in removing `1` from the current index, adding half size of the list,
applying modulo and re-adding `1`.

This implementation make all unit tests green and returns me the number `982`.

Now I have my two stars.

## Some feedback on Collections
To solve this problem, it would have been really cool to have a
`CircularLinkedList` or a `CircularArray`. In fact, it would be cool to have some
circular collections which handle automatically the lookup for an item N items away from
the current. To discuss.
