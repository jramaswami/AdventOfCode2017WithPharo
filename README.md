# Advent Of Code 2017 with Pharo
The repository in which Pharo community will store their solutions to the [Advent of Code 2017'](http://adventofcode.com)s programming puzzles.

The main goal is to centralize solutions of Pharo community for learning purpose. People will then be able to check how AOC puzzles can be solved in Pharo with different styles.

Another goal of this repository is to get a feedback on Pharo's Collection framework. If you find a missing method in one of the Pharo's collection during the implementation of a solution, please say it in your solution file

## How to participate
1. Fork this repository
2. Create a directory named according to your name (for example mine is `juliendelplanque`)
3. You can use this directory to store your puzzles solutions. 
4. Each time you solved a puzzle, commit your solution's markdown file into your personal fork of this repository and create a pull request.

### Pharo version
If you participate, please use Pharo 6.1 that you can get using the following command:
```
wget -O- get.pharo.org/61+vm | bash
```

Once the download is complete, launch Pharo using:
```
./pharo Pharo.image
```

### Structure of a solution
The solutions to AOC puzzles will take the form of Markdowns files. For each solution, use the `template.md` file as a basis.

An example of solution (which is a solution of AOC 2016 first puzzle) is available at `example/aoc2016-1.md`. Your solutions should be formatted similarly.
